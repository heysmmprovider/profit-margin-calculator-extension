# profit-margin-calculator-extension
This Chrome extension is designed to calculate and display profit margins for orders listed in tables on specified websites. It is particularly tailored for platforms like `heysmmreseller` and `heysmmprovider` but is versatile enough to be adapted for use on any similar panel that manages orders through a web interface.
